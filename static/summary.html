<H1>SUMMARY</H1><BR><BR><p>1 : As discussed, machine learning leverages algorithms to automatically model and find patterns in data, usually with the intention of predicting some target output.</p><p>2 : Once these data subsets are created from the primary dataset, a predictive model or classifier is trained using the training data, and then the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy is determined using the test data.</p><p>3 : UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS In unsupervised learning there is no known output, no training data set to instruct the learning algorithm.</p><p>4 : The algorithm makes a prediction for a new data point, by finding the closest data points in the training dataset, hence its nearest neighbor.</p><p>5 : In a summary, machine learning automatically learns a highly accurate predictive or classifier model, or finding unknown patterns in data, by leveraging learning algorithms and optimization techniques.</p><p>6 : First, assigning each data point to the closest cluster center, and second, each cluster center as the mean of the data points that are assigned to it.</p><p>7 : In an unsupervised learning, only the input data is known, and output data is not given to the algorithm.</p><p>8 : However, if model 3 becomes too complex, then it becomes too individualized for the given data point in the training set, and the model will not generalize well to new data.</p><p>9 : Transformation and Clustering Unsupervised transformations of a dataset are algorithms that create a new formation of the data which could easier for humans or other machine learning algorithms to understand compared to the original representation of the data.</p><p>10 : Clustering splits up the data points within a single cluster and predict a number to each data point, depicting cluster a particular point belongs to.</p><p>11 : SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS There are two major types of supervised machine learning algorithms, namely classification and regression.</p><p>12 : In its simplest version, the k-NN algorithm only considers exactly one nearest neighbor, which is the closest training data point to the point for prediction.</p><p>13 : Manifold learning is useful for exploring data, but is typically not used for the final goal is supervised learning.</p><p>14 : In supervised learning, if a model is able to make accurate predictions on data, it is said to generalize from the training set to the test data set.</p><p>15 : 2 In a typical Machine Learning dataset, the rows can be thought observations or data points and the columns for each data point represents the features of that observation and their values.</p><p>16 : Machine learning algorithms that learn from input/output pairs are called supervised learning algorithms because a supervisor provides guidance to the algorithms in the form of the desired outputs for each dataset they learn from.</p><p>17 : In supervised learning, the data contains a label which is the response variable that is being modeled, and with the goal being that algorithm predicts the value or class of the unseen data.</p><p>18 : Manifold learning algorithms are usually used for visualization, to compute a new representation of the training data, but donâ€™t allow transformations of new data.</p><p>19 : In other situations, machine learning algorithms can look for patterns in how data in the cloud is accessed, and report anomalies that could predict security breaches.</p><p>20 : For example, predicting the equipment health and failure based on historical data of equipment data, Image analysis of an astronomical phenomenon based on a large collection of images, prediction of sport team performance based on historical datasets and many more.</p><p>21 : In unsupervised learning, the learning algorithm is just given the input data to extract knowledge from this data.</p><p>22 : The goal and usage of Machine Learning is to build new and leverage existing algorithms to learn from datasets, in order to build generalizable models that give accurate predictions, or to find patterns, particularly with new and unseen similar data.</p>
