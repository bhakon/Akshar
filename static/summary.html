<H1>SUMMARY</H1><BR><BR><p>1 : Transformation and Clustering Unsupervised transformations of a dataset are algorithms that create a new formation of the data which could easier for humans or other machine learning algorithms to understand compared to the original representation of the data.</p><p>2 : Manifold learning algorithms are usually used for visualization, to compute a new representation of the training data, but donâ€™t allow transformations of new data.</p><p>3 : In supervised learning, if a model is able to make accurate predictions on data, it is said to generalize from the training set to the test data set.</p><p>4 : UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS In unsupervised learning there is no known output, no training data set to instruct the learning algorithm.</p><p>5 : Once these data subsets are created from the primary dataset, a predictive model or classifier is trained using the training data, and then the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy is determined using the test data.</p>
