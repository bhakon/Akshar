   Machine Learning (ML)  is essentially extracting knowledge from data sets.  It is a topic at the intersection of statistics,  artificial intelligence, and computer science and covers the topic of predictive analytics and statistical learning. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a  branch of computer science which studies building machines  capable of intelligent behavior, while Stanford University  defines machine learning as  the science of getting computers  to act without being explicitly programmed .  1  Clearly  Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence topic.
